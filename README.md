# AIRMASTER
(Thanks [NSA Name-O-Matic](https://divergentdave.github.io/nsa-o-matic/) for the name)

## Installation

### macOS

1. Install [homebrew](`https://brew.sh/`)
2. In your terminal, run `brew install tesseract`
3. Build Go project or download a release
4. Copy the configuration found in the Config section and place it in `~/.AIRMASTER.json`


## How to use

### Listing domain names

A good way to get a domain list is registering for [ExpiredDomains](https://www.expireddomains.net/) and using the [Export .COM feature](https://member.expireddomains.net/export/expiredcom/?export=textfile).

If you want to get a domain with specific keywords, you can use the keywords feature. This will take a bit longer and have less results, but it can still work extremely well.

1. With a domain list file

`AIRMASTER list --file ./path/to/file.txt`

2. With keywords

`AIRMASTER list --keyword max --keyword cool`

If multiple keywords are specified, they are combined by AND, so in the example above, you will get `maxiscool.com, max-is-kinda-cool.com, cool-memes-to-the-max.com`

### Purchasing domain names

Purchasing domain names uses the domains found by listing domains (see above) and adds an extra step to allow you to purchase the domain name. This is very simple: just add the `--purchase` flag to the end of a `list` command

Example:

`AIRMASTER list --file ./path/to/file.txt --purchase`

```
max@seldon ~> AIRMASTER list --file ~/Downloads/domains_2017-08-01_16_07_03.txt --purchase
Using config file: /Users/max/.AIRMASTER.json
Found available domain pavpal-login-account.com (Phishing)
-1. Do not purchase
0. Purchase with GoDaddy for $7490000
Choose an option: 0
Success!
```

Another way to purchase domains is actually to use output from the `list` command. This is useful if you want to leave AIRMASTER alone for a while while you grab a coffee, or while you're reading documentation on Windows Me because your target is using that for some reason.

```
AIRMASTER list --file ~/Downloads/domains.txt > /tmp/available

*20 minuites later* - Edit list from /tmp/available as you'd like to

AIRMASTER purchase --list /tmp/available
```

The help *should* be obvious, so if you are stuck, try using `AIRMASTER --help`. (Although if you are still stuck, please create an issue)
